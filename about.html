      <h2>This is My Story</h2>
			<img src="assets/images/profile.png" alt="Megan Picture">
			<p class="body1">I’m a tech-savvy millennial that has always loved creating
				pretty things and helping people. Whether that was by
				designing locker signs for the football players --- I
				cheered for every Friday night in high school, or making
				beautiful presentations for my college assignments, if I
				got to be creative, I was all over it. Little did I know that
				what I was doing graphic design.</p>
			<p class="body1">Growing up, design was not an option. I was set to find a
				stable salary job and pursue a masters in the medical
				industry, but my status as the black sheep of the family
				is solidified since I am the only one without a
				post-graduate degree. After college, I spent four years in
				corporate America. I bounced around during that time
				between industries with the most time spent in real
				estate, but I never found a role that truly fulfilled me. No
				matter what the job was, I was always willing to help
				with the creative tasks. I created invitations for company
				functions, plus marketing flyers and social media posts
				for the communities I worked in and even started
				dabbling in web design. Developing my design and
				marketing skills or conquering a new creative software.
				was my escape.</p>
			<p class="body1">Eventually, I came to a point where I decided to leave my
				steady 9 to 5 to follow where my heart lied, design. I set
				out to grow my graphic and web design skills while
				freelancing for small businesses and entrepreneurs. I
				have helped clients build their online presence through
				professional websites and social media platforms.
				Having the ability to help businesses all over the country,
				improve their brand recognition through online
				marketing in this digital age has been my bliss. Currently,
				I work in all aspects of marketing and design, but I am
				striving towards making web design and branding my
				full-time focus. The joy I can create for clients when I
				ing their story to life makes my heart happy and is the
				most important reason I do what I do. I have come a
				long way since making locker signs, but now I am a
				cheerleader of brands.</p>
