      <h2>This is My Story</h2>
      <p class="body1">Iâ€™m a tech-savvy millennial that has always loved creating<br>
        pretty things and helping people. Whether that was by<br>
        designing locker signs for the football players --- I<br>
        cheered for every Friday night in high school, or making<br>
        beautiful presentations for my college assignments, if I<br>
        got to be creative, I was all over it. Little did I know that<br>
        what I was doing graphic design.<br><br>

        Growing up, design was not an option. I was set to find a<br>
        stable salary job and pursue a masters in the medical<br>
        industry, but my status as the black sheep of the family<br>
        is solidified since I am the only one without a<br>
        post-graduate degree. After college, I spent four years in<br>
        corporate America. I bounced around during that time<br>
        between industries with the most time spent in real<br>
        estate, but I never found a role that truly fulfilled me. No<br>
        matter what the job was, I was always willing to help<br>
        with the creative tasks. I created invitations for company<br>
        functions, plus marketing flyers and social media posts<br>
        for the communities I worked in and even started<br>
        dabbling in web design. Developing my design and<br>
        marketing skills or conquering a new creative software<br>
        was my escape.<br><br>

        Eventually, I came to a point where I decided to leave my<br>
        steady 9 to 5 to follow where my heart lied, design. I set<br>
        out to grow my graphic and web design skills while<br>
        freelancing for small businesses and entrepreneurs. I<br>
        have helped clients build their online presence through<br>
        professional websites and social media platforms.<br>
        Having the ability to help businesses all over the country,<br>
        improve their brand recognition through online<br>
        marketing in this digital age has been my bliss. Currently,<br>
        I work in all aspects of marketing and design, but I am<br>
        striving towards making web design and branding my<br>
        full-time focus. The joy I can create for clients when I<br>
        ing their story to life makes my heart happy and is the<br>
        most important reason I do what I do. I have come a<br>
        long way since making locker signs, but now I am a<br>
        cheerleader of brands.</p>
