                I’m a tech-savvy millennial that
                has always loved creating pretty
                things and helping people.
                Whether that was by designing
                locker signs for the football
                players --- I cheered for every
                Friday night in high school, or
                making beautiful presentations
                for my college assignments, if I
                got to be creative, I was all over
                it. Little did I know that what I
                was doing graphic design.

            <p class="body2 right">
                Growing up, design was not
                an option. I was set to find a
                stable salary job and pursue a
                masters in the medical
                industry, but my status as the
                black sheep of the family is
                solidified since I am the only
                one without a post-graduate
                degree. After college, I spent
                four years in corporate
                America. I bounced around
                during that time between
                industries with the most time
                spent in real estate, but I
                never found a role that truly
                fulfilled me.

                No matter what the job was,
                I was always willing to help
                with the creative tasks. I
                created invitations for
                company functions, plus
                marketing flyers and social
                media posts for the
                communities I worked in and
                even started dabbling in web
                design. Developing my
                design and marketing skills
                or conquering a new creative
                software was my escape.

                Eventually, I came to a point
                where I decided to leave my
                steady 9 to 5 to follow where
                my heart lies, design. I set
                out to grow my graphic and
                web design skills while
                freelancing for small
                businesses and
                entrepreneurs. I have helped
                clients build their online
                presence through
                professional websites and
                social media platforms.
                Having the ability to help
                businesses all over the
                country, improve their brand
                recognition through online
                marketing in this digital age
                has been my bliss.

                Currently, I work in all
                aspects of marketing and
                design, but I am striving
                towards making web design
                and branding my full-time
                focus. The joy I can create
                for clients when I bring their
                story to life makes my heart
                happy and is the most
                important reason I do what I
                do. I have come a long way
                since making locker signs,
                but now I am a cheerleader of brands.
