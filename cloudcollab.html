					final changes, they were turned
					into little mockups of actual
					documents vs. icons to give it

		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<h2>Challenges Faced are Lessons Learned</h2>
		<div>
			<article>
				<p class="body1">At the beginning of this project, I was somewhat
					surprised that the task was to enter an already
					congested and competitive industry but had very
					little tangibles on how the product should stand
					out. The social media aspect of the idea was
					intriguing, and I agreed it seemed to be a hole in
					the market. I was excited to take on the challenge.
					The steps that I took to go from having very little
					ideas in the beginning to a thoughtfully
					esearched, developed, and designed prototype
					were crucial to the success of this project. The
					design process allowed  Cloud Collab to come to
					fruition and become a product that I was proud to
					add to my portfolio.</p>

				<p class="body1">The biggest challenge of this project was it’s
					three-week time frame. If given more time, I would
					have spent it initially growing my participant base for
					the user survey, to diversify my user pool and their
					feedback. I would have also conducted additional
					usability tests throughout the design process to
					eceive different input about the useer experience of
					Cloud Collab. There were several design learning
					curves I had to master. For instance, focusing on
					sizing and spacing elevated my initial design. I also
					had to learn to make the landing page and
					supporting pages look as legitimate as possible
					Cloud Collab was an exciting project to work on and
					inspired me to get my head in the clouds.</p>
