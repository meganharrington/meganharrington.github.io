			<h4>There are plenty of apps that can help you find restaurants in your area as well as ways to
				 rank your experience at those restaurants, but there is not an app that looks at the food
				 individually or more specifically the dessert items on a menu. Dessert is often seen as a
				  splurge item which means people do not want to risk being unsatisfied with their order.
					The task at hand was to create an app that would take the guesswork out of finding which
					restaurants in a given area offer dessert, and of those establishments which provide the
					best dishes. The primary questions that needed to be answered were: what features would
					solve these problems, what should the company name and branding be, and who is the
					target audience?</h4>

			<p class="body1">I chose Quiche Sans as my logo font and main headings because it was modern, clean but

				Sans as the supporting fonts because they have incredibly similar characters to Quiche
				Sans. But they are not humanist fonts, making them easier to read in paragraph texts and
				on a smaller scale. Knowing that they are all very similar, I utilized a variety of weights and
				color (blacks vs. lighter greys)  when I designed CRAVING’s content to create visual
				hierarchy.

		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<h2>Challenges Faced are Lessons Learned</h2>
		<div>
			<article>
				<p class="body1">At the beginning of this project, I knew that I often
					wondered where I could find the best restaurant
					desserts in my area, but there was not a tool that could
					help me with that.  I was excited to take on the
					challenge to create an app that I always wanted. I
					quickly found out it was something others would find
					helpful as well. The steps that I took to go from an idea
					to help users satisfy their dessert cravings in the
					beginning to a thoughtfully researched, developed, and
					designed prototype was crucial to the success of this
					project. The design process allowed CRAVING to come
					to fruition and become a product that I would love to
					develop one day.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<p class="body1">The biggest challenge of this project was the time frame. If
					given more time, I would have spent it initially growing my
					participant base for the user survey. This would have
					allowed me to diversify my user pool and their feedback. I
					would have also conducted usability tests and additional
					preference tests throughout the design process to receive
					input about the design and function of CRAVING so that it
					could be even more refined. Lastly, I would have designed
					a night mode prototype as well since I feel like this would
					be a great date night app that could have a more sultry
					vibe in the evening. CRAVING was a fun project to work on
					and inspired me to take my hunger for product design to
					the next level.</p>
