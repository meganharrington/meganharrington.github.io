                <p class="body1">I am an animal lover who is passionate about traveling.
                  It took a few years of soul searching post-college to
                  realize my passion for design was the career I was
                  always meant to have. My path towards the UX/ UI world
                  is not conventional, but I have learned a lot about
                  myself, the industry, and serving clients along the way.</p>
