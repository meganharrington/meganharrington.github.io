		<p>The Challenge</p>
		<h3>The task at hand was to enter the crowded cloud storage and online<br>
			collaboration industry but to find holes in the market when it came to<br>
			collaborating on and sharing documents through social media like features. The<br>
			primary questions that needed to be answered were: what features would help<br>
			us stand out, should the platform be a desktop or mobile app, what should the<br>
			company name and branding be, and who is the target audience?

				have collaborations or “collabs” with brands on<br>
				Instagram and Youtube, which is why I went with Cloud<br>
				Collab. It identifies it as a cloud platform but has the<br>
				social media and teamwork aspect covered. Plus, it<br>

				together to complete a project. The 3-D look of the cloud<br>
				has our signature navy in the background to show the<br>

		<h5>Iterations to Deliverables</h5>
		<h3>The final phase of the project was to create a high fidelity prototype that was<br>
			complete with all of the branding components. Three iterations of the design<br>

			to test the aesthetic and function of Cloud Collab. With those changes in<br>
			effect, a preference test was conducted on iteration two that focused on small<br>
			design details as well as an overall critique from a mentor. That feedback led to<br>
			the finalization of the design and the prototype that was delivered. The<br>

		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<h2>Challenges Faced are Lessons Learned</h2>
		<div>
			<article>
				<p class="body1">At the beginning of this project, I was somewhat<br>
					surprised that the task was to enter an already<br>
					congested and competitive industry but had very<br>
					little tangibles on how the product should stand<br>
					out. The social media aspect of the idea was<br>
					intriguing, and I agreed it seemed to be a hole in<br>
					the market. I was excited to take on the challenge.<br>
					The steps that I took to go from having very little<br>
					ideas in the beginning to a thoughtfully<br>
					esearched, developed, and designed prototype<br>
					were crucial to the success of this project. The<br>
					design process allowed  Cloud Collab to come to<br>
					fruition and become a product that I was proud to<br>
					add to my portfolio.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<p class="body1">The biggest challenge of this project was it’s<br>
					three-week time frame. If given more time, I would<br>
					have spent it initially growing my participant base for<br>
					the user survey, to diversify my user pool and their<br>
					feedback. I would have also conducted additional<br>
					usability tests throughout the design process to<br>
					eceive different input about the useer experience of<br>
					Cloud Collab. There were several design learning<br>
					curves I had to master. For instance, focusing on<br>
					sizing and spacing elevated my initial design. I also<br>
					had to learn to make the landing page and<br>
					supporting pages look as legitimate as possible<br>
					Cloud Collab was an exciting project to work on and<br>
					inspired me to get my head in the clouds.</p>
