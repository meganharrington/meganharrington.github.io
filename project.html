		<h3>The task at hand was to enter the crowded cloud storage and online
			collaboration industry but to find holes in the market when it came to
			collaborating on and sharing documents through social media like features. The
			primary questions that needed to be answered were: what features would help
			us stand out, should the platform be a desktop or mobile app, what should the
			company name and branding be, and who is the target audience?</h3>

				to incorporate it into the name. When I started to think
				about the social media side, I realized that influencers
				are at the forefront of online marketing. They often
				have collaborations or “collabs” with brands on
				Instagram and Youtube, which is why I went with Cloud
				Collab. It identifies it as a cloud platform but has the
				social media and teamwork aspect covered. Plus, it
				rolls off the tongue.</p>

			<p class="body1">The logo represents the balance of professionalism and

			come together to create a cloud, much like users work
			together to complete a project. The 3-D look of the cloud
			has our signature navy in the background to show the
			core features of online document creation while the light
			blue elevates the design which is symbolic of how the

		<h5>Iterations to Deliverables</h5>
		<h3>The final phase of the project was to create a high fidelity prototype that was
			complete with all of the branding components. Three iterations of the design
			were designed. After iteration one was finished, a usability test was conducted
			to test the aesthetic and function of Cloud Collab. With those changes in
			effect, a preference test was conducted on iteration two that focused on small
			design details as well as an overall critique from a mentor. That feedback led to
			the finalization of the design and the prototype that was delivered. The
			following are examples of major changes that occurred to the sales landing
			page, dashboard, and finding friend screens.</h3>

		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<h2>Challenges Faced are Lessons Learned</h2>
		<div>
			<article>
				<p class="body1">At the beginning of this project, I was somewhat
					surprised that the task was to enter an already
					congested and competitive industry but had very
					little tangibles on how the product should stand
					out. The social media aspect of the idea was
					intriguing, and I agreed it seemed to be a hole in
					the market. I was excited to take on the challenge.
					The steps that I took to go from having very little
					ideas in the beginning to a thoughtfully
					esearched, developed, and designed prototype
					were crucial to the success of this project. The
					design process allowed  Cloud Collab to come to
					fruition and become a product that I was proud to
					add to my portfolio.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<p class="body1">The biggest challenge of this project was it’s
					three-week time frame. If given more time, I would
					have spent it initially growing my participant base for
					the user survey, to diversify my user pool and their
					feedback. I would have also conducted additional
					usability tests throughout the design process to
					eceive different input about the useer experience of
					Cloud Collab. There were several design learning
					curves I had to master. For instance, focusing on
					sizing and spacing elevated my initial design. I also
					had to learn to make the landing page and
					supporting pages look as legitimate as possible
					Cloud Collab was an exciting project to work on and
					inspired me to get my head in the clouds.</p>
